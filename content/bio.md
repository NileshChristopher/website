Varsha Bansal is an independent journalist based in Los Angeles. She writes at the intersection of Technology, AI and Humans.

Our lives have moved online, and I am curious about how technology impacts people in expected and unexpected ways.

I am a tech reporter from India with a decade of experience writing about how technology impacts our lives. I regularly write for [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/author/varsha-bansal/), [TIME](https://time.com/author/varsha-bansal/), [Slate](https://slate.com/author/varsha-bansal), [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/author/varsha-bansal/), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/11/google-gemini-ai-training-humans), [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/2/23/as-indians-expect-groceries-in-10-mins-delivery-agents-struggle), [Rest of World](https://restofworld.org/author/varsha-bansal/) and [Coda Story](https://www.codastory.com/author/varshabansal/). Previously I worked with top Indian business dailies Economic Times and Mint.

Most recently I was a Knight-Bagehot Fellow 2024-25 at Columbia University in New York. In 2024, I won the _Freelance Journalist of the Year_ Award by One World Media and _Outstanding Business Reporting_ award by South Asian Journalists Association. In 2023, I was longlisted for _International Journalist of the Year_ Award by One World Media for my series of stories on how technology is impacting Indian gig workers. In 2022, I was an inaugural AI Accountability Fellow with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.

I was also a guest faculty at Asian College of Journalism in India for the Business Feature writing course.
