# Canela Font Files

Place your Canela font files in this directory:

- `Canela-Regular.woff2` (preferred)
- `Canela-Regular.woff` (fallback)
- `Canela-Regular.ttf` (fallback)
- `Canela-Bold.woff2`
- `Canela-Bold.woff`
- `Canela-Bold.ttf`
- `Canela-Italic.woff2`

## Obtaining Canela Font

Canela is a commercial font from Commercial Type. You can purchase it from:
https://commercialtype.com/catalog/canela

## Alternative: Using Canela from Squarespace

If you're currently using Canela on your Squarespace site, you can:
1. Check the Squarespace site's source code to see how it loads Canela
2. Extract the font files if they're self-hosted
3. Or use the same font loading method Squarespace uses

## Temporary Fallback

Until Canela font files are added, the site will use Georgia as a fallback serif font.
